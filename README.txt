A simple, minimalist template that actually began life as an unused redesign of my
personal site. Includes a (configurable) parallax background effect, Poptrox-powered
lightbox gallery, a bunch of pre-styled elements, and Sass sources for the Sass-inclined.

you can use for pretty much whatever.

Feedback, bug reports, and comments are not only welcome, but strongly encouraged :)
